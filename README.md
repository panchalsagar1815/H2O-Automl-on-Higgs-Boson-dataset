# **Project Title: H2O AutoML on Higgs Boson**

**Overview:**
The "H2O AutoML on Higgs Boson" project focuses on utilizing the H2O AutoML framework to analyze and predict the classification of Higgs Boson events based on various features. The dataset includes features such as EventId, DER_mass_MMC, DER_mass_transverse_met_lep, DER_mass_vis, DER_pt_h, and several others. The goal is to optimize the model selection process and achieve accurate classification using the H2O AutoML capabilities.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Features:**
   - The dataset contains features related to the Higgs Boson events, including mass measurements, transverse momentum, delta eta between jets, and various other physical quantities.
   - The target variable is labeled as 'Label,' indicating the classification of events as either signal ('s') or background ('b').

2. **H2O AutoML Model:**
   - Utilized the H2OAutoML model developed by Hugging Face to automate the model selection process.
   - The AutoML process involves training multiple models, including Deep Learning, Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Extremely Randomized Trees (XRT), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM).
   - Evaluated model performance based on metrics such as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC), log loss, mean per-class error, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean squared error (MSE).

3. **Model Selection and Evaluation:**
   - The project built a variety of models, and the best-performing model was the XRT (Extremely Randomized Trees) with an AUC of 1, log loss of 0.011546, and zero mean per-class error.
   - The AutoML process also generated stacked ensemble models, including the BestOfFamily and AllModels ensembles.

4. **Deep Learning Model Metrics:**
   - The Deep Learning model had competitive metrics, including a low log loss of 0.0851, mean per-class error of 0.0278, and an impressive AUC of 0.9949.
   - The confusion matrix indicated a low error rate, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in classifying signal and background events.

5. **Comparison with Other Models:**
   - Compared the performance of the Deep Learning model with other models generated by AutoML, including Distributed Random Forest and Generalized Linear Model.
   - The best model, as determined by the AutoML process, was the Extremely Randomized Trees (XRT).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The project successfully leveraged the H2O AutoML framework to optimize model selection for the classification of Higgs Boson events.
   - The Deep Learning model and other ensemble models demonstrated strong performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of the AutoML process.
   - The selected XRT model achieved the highest AUC, providing a robust solution for accurate classification in Higgs Boson event analysis.

The evaluation metric is the approximate median significance (AMS):


where

s, b : unnormalized true positive and false positive rates, respectively,
b_r =10 is the constant regularization term,
\\(\log\\) is the natural log.
More precisely, let \\((y_1, \ldots, y_n) \in \{\text{b},\text{s}\}^n\\) be the vector of true test labels, let \\((\hat{y}_1, \ldots, \hat{y}_n) \in \{\text{b},\text{s}\}^n\\) be the vector of predicted (submitted) test labels, and let \\((w_1, \ldots, w_n) \in {\mathbb{R}^+}^n\\) be the vector of weights. Then


and


where the indicator function \\(\mathbb{1}\{A\}\\) is 1 if its argument \\(A\\) is true and 0 otherwise.

EventId is a unique identifier for each event. The list of EventIds must correspond to the exact list of EventIds in test.csv, but the ordering can be arbitrary.
RankOrder is a permutation of the integer list [1,550000] . The higher the rank, the more signal-like is the event. Most predictors output a real-valued score for each event in the test set, in which case RankOrder is just the ordering of the test points according to the score. The RankOrder is not used for computing the AMS, but it allows the organizers to compute other metrics (e.g., ROC) related to the classification task, which is not captured entirely by the classification alone.
Class is either "b" or "s", and it indicates if your prediction (yi above in the formal definition) for the event is background or signal. The AMS will be calculated based on the (hidden) weights of events that you mark "s"
